<h3 align="left">What is AWS Glue?</h3>
AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It helps in preparing and transforming data so that it can be easily analyzed and used for various purposes.<br>
<br>AWS Glue simplifies the process of extracting data from different sources, such as databases, data lakes, or streaming platforms.
Once the data is extracted, AWS Glue provides tools and features to transform and clean the data. This includes performing operations like filtering, aggregating, joining, and applying custom transformations to the data. It generates code and scripts automatically to execute these transformations.<br>
<br>One of the advantages of AWS Glue is its scalability. It can handle large volumes of data and perform transformations in parallel, enabling faster processing times. It integrates well with other AWS services, allowing seamless data integration and analytics workflows.<br>
